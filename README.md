## Description 

In this week's challenge we were tasked with using Node.js to generate a team roster based on user input with the Inquirer module.

We also practiced more test driven development using the Jest module, which is also a dependency for this project.

When the user finishes answering prompts on the command line, an html page is generated that also features styling. This page lists different team members and, depending on the team member's role, lists more specific information for the team member.
